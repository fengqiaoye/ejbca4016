The External Registration Authority Client
------------------------------------------

This client can be used for simple interactions and testing with the External RA database.

The connection to the External RA database is configured in META-INF/persistence.xml and follows
the Java Persistence API standard with Hibernate as persistence provider.

The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver JAR should be copied to the 'endorsed'-directory.

Execute the client without arguments to see the list of options and operations.
