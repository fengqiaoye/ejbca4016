This is a proxy to be used to transfer CMP requests received to a CA.
The proxy is a stand alone module that runs on another mahing than the CA itself.

There is one proxy for receiving TCP requests and another for receiving HTTP requests.
The README is same for both proxies.
If this README is in the same directory as the file 'cmpProxy-x.x.x.war' you got the HTTP proxy.
If this README is in the same directory as the file 'cmpTcpProxy.jar' you got the TCP proxy.



TCP proxy.
---------
Build the proxy by:
cd ${EJBCA_HOME}/modules/cmpProxy
ant -f build-tcp.xml

The proxy files are put in ${EJBCA_HOME}/dist/cmpTcpProxy, here after referred to as ${PROXY_HOME}.

The proxy is started like this: java -jar ${PROXY_HOME}/cmpTcpProxy.jar [ CONFIGFILE ]

${PROXY_HOME} is the directory containing this file (README).

Configuration properties are read from a file. This file is search for like this until an existing file is found:
1. The path given as argument (CONFIGFILE) when starting the proxy.
2. ./conf/cmpProxy.properties
3. ./cmpProxy.properties
4. ${PROXY_HOME}/properties/cmpProxy.properties

Use ${PROXY_HOME}/properties/cmpProxy.properties as a template or change it.

The program could be started from any directory.

Log is written to the "stdout" and to the file ./ctb.log (in the current directory).
The logging (levels output etc) could be changed in the file: ${PROXY_HOME}/properties/log4j.xml
If you are not familiar with log4j have a look at http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html

To define a service on Windows for this application http://yajsw.sourceforge.net is usable.
If this is done make sure to:
* Set wrapper.work.dir to the directory with your cmpProxy.properties . All files in the configuration with
  no absolute path will be relative to this directory.
* Make sure with the Windows service GUI that the service is started by logging on to wrapper.app.account .


HTTP proxy
----------
The HTTP proxy can be built and deployed with apache Tomcat 6.x. It should be possible to use other servlet containers, but this has not been tested.

You got to tell where the servlet jars for your servlet engine are located when building the http proxy.
For tomcat on debian this is done like this:

export SERVLET_ENGINE_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat6
or if you just unpacked the tomcat distribution in /opt
export SERVLET_ENGINE_HOME=/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.26

Build the proxy by:
cd ${EJBCA_HOME}/modules/cmpProxy
ant -f build-http.xml

The proxy files are put in ${EJBCA_HOME}/dist/cmpHttpProxy, here after referred to as ${PROXY_HOME}.

Deploy 'cmpProxy-x.x.x.war' to the servlet container. With  this could be done with a GUI or on the command line.

Configuration properties are read from a file. This file is search for like this until an existing file is found:
1. The file with the name of the property 'configFileName' in the servlet definition.
   The servlet is defined in 'WEB-INF/web.xml' located in 'cmpProxy-x.x.x.war'
2. ./conf/cmpProxy.properties
3. ./cmpProxy.properties
4. './WEB-INF/classes/cmpProxy.properties' in 'WEB-INF/web.xml' located in 'cmpProxy-x.x.x.war'.

The path of the current directory './' is dependent on the servlet engine and the installation of the servlet engine.
Tomacat6 installed with a debian package has current directory '/var/lib/tomcat6'.

With default configuration the log is written to './logs/cmpProxy.log'.
The log is configured in 'WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml' located in 'cmpProxy-x.x.x.war'.

You can see that the proxy is deployed correctly using a simple url:
http://localhost:8080/cmpProxy-3.10.2/
if the war file is called cmpProxy-3.10.2.war. You can easily call the war file simply cmpProxy.war to have the, always same, url:
http://localhost:8080/cmpProxy/

The URL for the CMP proxy, to be used by clients are:
http://your-proxy-server:8080/cmpProxy/cmp
If the war file is called cmpProxy.war.

A sample command for the EJBCA Client Tool Box's CMP stress test tool to use the proxy is:
./ejbcaClientToolBox.sh CMPTest localhost /AdminCA1.cacert.pem  1 1 KeyId 8080 http /cmpProxy/cmp
