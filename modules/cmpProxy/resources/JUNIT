To test the proxy with the EJBCA CMP unit tests (runcmp) you got to have some system variables set.

The variables that has to be set are:
httpCmpProxyURL		The URL of the proxy http servlet.
tcpCmpProxyIP		The IP address of the TCP proxy.
tcpCmpProxyPort		The port of the TCP proxy.

An example how the junit could be started:
ant -DhttpCmpProxyURL=http://your-proxy-server:8080/cmpProxy-3.10.2/cmp -DtcpCmpProxyIP=your-proxy-server -DtcpCmpProxyPort=5587 runcmp
