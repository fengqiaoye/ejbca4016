#####
# Configuration file for default values for the stand-alone SCEP RA Server
# Configure as you please, but all values must be set to something.
#
# Default values (that you enter here) is built into the application and deployed
# as default values.
#
# 'datasource.jndi-name-prefix' (see conf/database.properties.sample) and 'appserver.home'
# (see conf/ejbca.properties.sample) also has to be configured. 
#####

# Allow dynamic re-configuration.
#
# By setting this property to true, you can also dynamically re-configure
# the RA by changing values in properties files in the file system.
# 
# You can put a scep.properties file in your "app server runtime home"/conf directory
# to override these values. To find out which this directory is, it is logged during startup as for example:
# [ExtraConfiguration] Added file to configuration source: /opt/jboss-4.2.2.GA/bin/conf/scep.properties
# This file is re-read if changes so changes can be made in runtime.
#
# You can put a /etc/ejbca/conf/extra/scep.properties file to override these values.
# This file is re-read if changes so changes can be made in runtime.
#
# Finally you can override anything by setting system properties for your appserver, for example:
# java -Dscep.ra.authpwd=mysecret
allow.external-dynamic.configuration=false

# Path to RA keystore. Should be a full pathname.
scep.ra.keyStorePath.1=/opt/jboss-4.2.2.GA/bin/conf/keystore/sceprakeystore.p12

# Password to the RA keystore configured above
scep.ra.keyStorePassword.1=foo123

# Advanced users: In theory it is possible to have several SCEP RAs configured with different keystores. 
# In that case add more keystores with .2 etc. And configure new Servlets and mappings in src/WEB-INF/web.xml 
# with these keystoreNumber.
  
# Set to another value than none if the Scep RA should require 
# a specific password in the SCEP request. 
# This should be used with createOrEditUser=true and will in this case be a set password 
# required in the SCEP Request message. If this password is correct, the request will be automatically granted. 
#
# Leave as 'none' to not require any password, i.e. allow anything.
# If createOrEditUser=false this will require the user to be pre-registered and the password in the request will
# be used to authenticate this user with the pre-registered password.
#
# If createOrEdit=false and authPwd=none you can also use Approvals in EJBCA to require an administrator to 
# approve the request in the CA Admin-GUI before a certificate is issued. 
scep.ra.authPwd=none

# Defines if a request to the RA will create a new user, 
# or edit an existing in EJBCA. If false users must be 
# pre-registered in EJBCA with a pwd.
scep.ra.createOrEditUser=false

# The Certificate profile used to register new SCEP users, if createOrEditUser=true.
scep.ra.certificateProfile=ENDUSER

# The End entity profile used to register new SCEP users, if createOrEditUser=true.
scep.ra.entityProfile=EMPTY

# The default CA used to register new SCEP users, if createOrEditUser=true.
scep.ra.defaultCA=ScepCA

# Mapping a CAs issuer DN (as from the Admin-GUI->Edit CAs), which will be 
# received from the client to a CA name.
# This is used to find a CA from the request. If no CA can be found with a mapping, the defaultCA is used.
# You can create several mappings for different CAs like this.
# Note that all =, : or whitespace must be escaped with a \. See example below. 
CN\=Scep\ CA,O\=EJBCA\ Sample,C\=SE=ScepCA

# Database connection information. The right JDBC driver has to be installed manually in the application server.
# SQL dialect and driver class name is derived from the JDBC URL.
scep.ra.datasource.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/messages
scep.ra.datasource.username=ejbca
scep.ra.datasource.password=ejbca
